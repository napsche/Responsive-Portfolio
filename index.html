      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Nicole Apsche. I am originally from Bucks County, but I have lived in Philadelphia for 8 years. I currently live in West Philadelphia with my boyfriend and my cat, Crouton. I originally moved to Philadelphia to attend Temple Univeristy, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Neuroscience. I moved to Washington Square after living in North Philadelphia for four years. I lived in my apartment until my boyfriend, Luke, bought our house. One of our favorite passtimes now is working together to renovate the house!</p>

      <p>Before starting at the company I am with now, I was a bartender at Copabanana in Univeristy City for six years. I still bartend Sunday brunch just because I love it! I am currently working as an Account Executive for a talent acquisition firm called KGTiger. We are based out of Bala Cynwyd, and offer a variety of solutions to modern talent acquisition struggles. I was excited to begin the Penn LPS Coding Boot Camp to enhance my skillset and give myself a competitive advantage in my career.</p>
